# A tribute to Maria SkÅ‚odowska Curie

> Nothing in this world is to be feared... only understood. - Maria Curie

I made this tribute to Maria Curie while I was travelling around Poland, I was inspired by Maria's life after visiting the museum dedicated to her which is based in the house where she grew up in Warsaw.

## Specs

Overall, I am very happy with the result, it's a simple grid layout with primary colours to seperate the areas out, I liked the idea of using three main photos in fullscreen device mode but only one photo in mobile device mode.

## To be improves

- I'm still not sure about having so much information packed onto one webpage but i wasn't sure how to cut it down. Maria Curie lived a very full life! If I were to do it again I would cut down on the amount of info, especially for mobile devices where it could get overwhelming.
